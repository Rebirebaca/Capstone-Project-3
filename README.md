# Airbnb_Analysis

### Introduction
Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their property with people who are looking for accommodations, typically for short stays.Airbnb began in 2008 when two designers who had space to share hosted three travelers looking for a place to stay. Now, millions of Hosts and guests have created free Airbnb accounts to enjoy each other's unique view of the world.Airbnb offers hosts a relatively easy way to earn some income from their property.

## Domain : Travel Industry, Property management and Tourism

## Problem Statement :
This project aims to data extract and analyze , perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.

## Prerequisites
Python -- Programming Language
pandas -- Python Library for Data Visualization
json --- It importing the functionality provided by the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) module/library into the current Python script or environment.
streamlit -- Python framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps
plotly -- Python Module that is used for data visualization and supports various graphs

## Project Workflow
### Step 1 -- Establish MongoDB Connection
Get a data from airbnb JSON data and extract hotel data,room data,review data,reviewer data, host data and initiate the process of retrieving the Airbnb dataset from it.

### Step 2 -- Data Cleaning and Preparation
Prepare the Airbnb dataset for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization tasks by first addressing missing values, eliminating duplicates, and making appropriate data type transformations. This critical data preprocessing step is essential for maintaining data integrity and consistency, ensuring that the dataset is in an optimal state for further analysis.

### Step 3 -- Interactive Web Application
Create a web application using Streamlit that harnesses geospatial information from the Airbnb dataset to generate interactive maps, allowing users to explore and engage with location-based data related to Airbnb listings and properties. This application will empower users to visualize and interact with the geographical aspects of Airbnb data, enhancing their understanding of property distribution, pricing trends, and other relevant insights within a map-centric interface.

### Step 4 -- Price Analysis and Visualization
Utilize the refined dataset to conduct an analysis and generate visual representations showcasing the fluctuations in prices across various geographical locations, types of properties, and seasons. Develop interactive graphs and charts that empower users to investigate price distribution, standard scalar and correlations with other factor

### Step5 -- Power BI Dashboard
Utilize Tableau or Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that presents key insights from your analysis. Combine different visualizations, such as maps, charts, and tables, to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns.
